                  <h5>2.Difference between Global scope and block scope</h5>
                  <p>Ans: A javascript block scoped means that the variable defined within a block will not be accessible from outside the block.we can not access the let and const variables that we declare inside a block from outside a block</p>

                    <h5>3.How does javascript event loop works?</h5>
                    <p>Ans: The event loop is a process that waits for the Call Stack to be clear before pushing callbacks from the Task Queue to the Call Stack. Once the Stack is clear, the event loop triggers and checks the Task Queue for available callbacks. If there are any, it pushes it to the Call Stack, waits for the Call Stack to be clear again, and repeats the same process.

                    <h5>4.How many ways we can get undefined?</h5>
                    <p>Ans:undefined is a property of the global object.A variable that has not been assigned a value is of type undefined. A method or statement also returns undefined if the variable that is being evaluated does not have an assigned value. A function returns undefined if a value was not returned.
